# Week 3: Markov Decision Process (MDP)
Greetings, Adventurers! Welcome to Week 3 of our thrilling journey through the realms of reinforcement learning. This week is packed with excitement as we delve deep into the fascinating universe of Markov Decision Processes (MDP).

## ðŸš€ Markov Decision Process

These resources will guide you through the mathematical formulation and introduce you to the terminologies that form the backbone of MDP.

## ðŸ’¡ Solving MDP using Value Iteration

Now that you've mastered the fundamentals, let's gear up to solve MDPs using the powerful Value Iteration algorithm. I encourage everyone to comprehensively grasp this algorithm by thoroughly examining its proof and cultivating a strong intuition for its workings.
